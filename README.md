# Challenge—8 languages in 5 days (Shell Script Code)

This project is a challenge that I set for myself, during my vacation period. The idea was to develop the same small project: a simple calculator that asks for the user for two numbers and one character (a math operator), then performs the operation using the user's input.


# First day (03/04) - GO and RUST
For the first day, I tried two languages for the first time: GO and RUST. GO was relatively easy, but RUST presented a bit of a challenge. I finished the GO code in the same day and RUST code on 03/06.

# Second day (03/05) - Java
On the second day, I started coding with Java. Creating this simple code was easy, but after I finished it, I keep studying Java and tried for the first time use Spring Framework.

# Third day (03/06) - Python
On the third day, I started coding with Python, it was easy because I already had an experience with that programming language. So, before I ended, I start to study Django, a web framework for python.

# Fourth day (03/07) - C# and Shell Script
On the fourth day, I stated coding with C# and then moved to Shell Script. Writing in C# was my first experience with an “independent” code, without a teacher or a step-by-step course guiding me. About Shell Script, it isn't the first time I used. But it was a bit more complex then the order small code that was usual to me to write, for first time I used functions and case in a Shell Script code.

# Fifth day (03/08) - C++ and C
On the fifth day, I coded with C++ and C, it was my second time tring C++ but first time tring C. Both languages share the same concepts, so it wasn't difficult to write both codes.

# How to execute this Shell Script code
My enviroment was Ubuntu Mate 22.04, to be able to execute the shell script, you must go to the folder where the code is located, then run a chmod changing the permission to execute the code:

`chmod +x calculator.sh`

Then, use the command bellow to execute de script:

`./calculator.sh`

or

`bash calculator.sh`
